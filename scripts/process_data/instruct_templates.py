TASK_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "query_description": "The query description task involves describing documents potentially relevant to a user-provided query. Queries typically comprise keywords reflecting the user's information needs. The objective of the task is to articulate the characteristics and content of documents that would be considered pertinent to these keywords, aiding in the understanding and retrieval of relevant information.",
    "query_expansion": "The query expansion task involves elaborating an original, brief query into a longer, more detailed version while preserving the original search intent. This process enhances the search engine's understanding of the user's needs, leading to more accurate and relevant document retrieval.",
    "query_reformulation": "The query reformulation task enhances user-input queries to be more explicit and comprehensible for search engines. It addresses omissions typical of user queries, which often exclude common sense or contextually implied information. The refined query, therefore, includes all necessary details to guide the search engine towards retrieving the most relevant documents.",
    "query_clarification": "The query clarification task addresses unclear or ambiguous user queries by asking for further details or providing clarification options. This process helps refine the query, resulting in clearer and more precise search terms for improved search engine results.",
    "query_subtopic_generation": "The query subtopic generation task addresses the ambiguity of web searches by identifying and presenting various aspects of the initial query. This approach aids search engines in understanding the query's breadth, leading to more diverse and relevant search results.",
    "query_matching": "The query matching task involves determining whether two queries or texts, despite differing in expression, convey the same meaning. This is crucial in search tasks where identifying synonymous queries can enhance the relevance and accuracy of results.",
    "query_suggestion": "In search sessions, users often input a series of queries to fulfill a specific information need. The query suggestion task aims to analyze these queries and associated search behaviors to understand the user's intent and predict the next likely query, thereby enhancing the search experience.",
    "query_intent_classification": "User queries can have various search intents, such as informational (seeking knowledge about a topic), transactional (aiming to purchase a product), or navigational (looking to find a specific website). Accurately discerning the type of intent behind a query is crucial for search engines to tailor and refine their results effectively.",
    "fact_verification": "The fact verification task involves assessing whether a claim is supported or refuted by the given evidence. It requires a clear analysis of the relationship between the claim and the evidence, with careful scrutiny to determine if there is sufficient information for a conclusive judgment. Such detailed understanding aids search engines in achieving a deeper comprehension of the documents, enhancing their ability to deliver accurate and relevant results.",
    "summarization": "The text summarization task seeks to create a concise summary of one or more lengthy documents, encapsulating all vital information while omitting extraneous details. The summary must accurately reflect the content of the original documents without introducing any new information. Achieving this necessitates a profound understanding of the documents, which can significantly enhance the performance of search engines by providing distilled, relevant content.",
    "reading_comprehension": "The reading comprehension task requires generating an answer to a question using the information from a given context. It necessitates a deep understanding of the text's context and semantics, enabling search engines to more accurately rank the relevance of retrieved documents based on this nuanced comprehension.",
    "conversational_qa": "Conversational question-answering involves responding to a series of interrelated questions based on a given context. As these questions might build upon shared information, some details may be implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated. By comprehensively understanding and analyzing this dialogue structure, search engines can enhance their interpretation of user queries and their connections to relevant documents, thereby improving result accuracy and relevance.",
    "retrieval": "In the reranking task, search engines must understand the relationship between the user's query, which may be keywords or a sentence, and the potential documents. The goal is to ensure that the most relevant documents, those that best cover the user's information needs, are ranked highest. This requires a nuanced understanding of both the query's intent and the content of the documents.",
